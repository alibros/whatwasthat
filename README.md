## Setup

### 1. Get an OpenAI API Key

1. Sign in to the [OpenAI dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. Create an API key (or retrieve an existing one)
3. Copy the key ‚Äî you'll add it to your environment shortly

If you're using Azure OpenAI or a proxy endpoint, also note the base URL and model deployment name you'll need to target.

### 2. Get a TMDB API Key

1. Go to [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
2. Create a free account
3. Navigate to Settings ‚Üí API
4. Request an API Key (choose "Developer")
5. Copy your API key

### 3. Configure Environment

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
# Optional: set if you're using Azure OpenAI or a proxy endpoint
OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1
# Optional: override the default model (defaults to gpt-4o-mini)
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key_here
PORT=3000
```

If you're using the default OpenAI API (`api.openai.com`), you can remove `OPENAI_BASE_URL` or leave it empty. The `OPENAI_MODEL` variable lets you pick a preferred model; omit it to fall back to the default.

### 4. Install and Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` and start asking about your favorite movies and shows!

**Content Identification:**
